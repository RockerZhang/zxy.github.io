Robotics

<img style="float: right;" src="../images/traj.gif" width="300" height="300" /> 
We developed a nonlinear programming solver that generates highly dynamic motion-plans with full flight-phases for the hexapod robot daisy, which is manufactured by HEBI Robotics. This solver is able to automatically determine gait-sequence, step-timing, footholds, swing-leg motions and 6-DoF body motion over different terrains. We also apply simulated trajectories on a real hexapod robot via an open-loop trajectory tracking controller. The hexapod robot is able to simulate and climb a 30Â° ramp (at the limit of its mechanical capability).
