I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tamer Ba≈üar](http://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu/). I have also been fortunate to work with [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/) at the CMU Biorobotics Laboratory. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of control theory and reinforcement learning, especially in robust control, game theory, and multi-agent systems; with applications in legged/industrial robots.

* 12/2019: I have completed my internship at the CMU Biorobotics Lab.   
* 09/2019: Our paper accepted to **NeurIPS** 2019: [Non-cooperative inverse reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04220.pdf). This paper provides a new formalism for non-cooperative inverse RL, by modeling it as a zero-sum Markov game with one-sided incomplete information.
* 09/2019: Our new paper [State Estimation for Legged Robots Using Contact-Centric Leg Odometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05176.pdf) has been posted on arXiv. This paper proposes a new state estimation algorithm for legged robots that fuses contact information to improve estimation accuracy. 
* 07/2019: I am attending **ACC** 2019 to present our poster at the Workshop on Challenges and Solutions for Legged Robotics.
