I am a 4th-year undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tamer Ba≈üar](http://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu/), [Prof. Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/), and [Prof. Daniel Liberzon](http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/). I have also been fortunate to work with [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/) at the CMU Biorobotics Laboratory. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of control theory and reinforcement learning, especially in robust control, game theory, and multi-agent systems; with applications in legged/industrial robotics systems.
